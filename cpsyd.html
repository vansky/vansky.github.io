<h3>Join C.Psyd</h3>

I am currently accepting motivated graduate and undergraduate students to join my group on a long term basis. I do not accept students to my group on a short-term (e.g., summer) basis.<br><br>

If you are not currently at Cornell and are interested in having me for an advisor, please apply to Cornell linguistics following the normal application process. I get several emails every day asking to join C.Psyd, so I unfortunately cannot respond to all requests. Just apply through the normal application process, expressing an interest in joining my group and the admissions committee will forward me your application.<br><br>

If you are already at Cornell and would like to join my group, or if you're interested in meeting up at an upcoming conference, feel free to email me to setup a meeting. I get several emails for these purposes as well, so if I miss your email and fail to respond, I apologize.<br><br>

If you understand the above and still want to contact me, great! I want to know you and what interests you. Please email me with your name, academic status/year, a topic you are interesting in pursuing, and something you found interesting about a paper from my lab.<br><br>
