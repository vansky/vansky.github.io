The Computational Psycholinguistics Discussions research group (C.Psyd; Seaside) focuses on computational modeling of human language processing. We have two discussion groups that meet weekly: <a href="https://conf.ling.cornell.edu/compling/">CLab</a> and PsyLab. CLab is focused on computational modeling. PsyLab is focused on human language processing.

<h3>Join C.Psyd</h3>

I am always looking for motivated undergraduate and graduate students with whom to conduct interesting research. However, I get a lot of mail, so please read this before contacting me.
<br><br>
First, I cannot directly intervene on your behalf in acceptance to Cornell. Just follow the normal application process.
<br><br>
Second, I do not currently have funding for student researchers, so working with me would strictly be a way of gaining research experience while working on fun topics.
<br><br>
Third, my lab has grown very quickly, so I am not looking for single term (e.g., summer) researchers. Please understand that I get many requests to join my lab for a single term (especially summer), and I may not respond to all of them. If you are looking to join my lab on a long-term basis, feel free to contact me.
<br><br>
If you understand the above and still want to contact me, great! I want to know you and what interests you about my work. Please email me with your name, academic status/year, and something you found interesting about a paper from my lab.<br><br>
