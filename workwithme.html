I am always looking for motivated undergraduate and graduate students with whom to conduct interesting research. However, I get a lot of mail, so please read this before contacting me.


First, I cannot directly intervene on your behalf in acceptance to Cornell. Just follow the normal application process.


Second, I do not currently have funding for student researchers, so working with me would strictly be a way of gaining research experience while working on fun topics.


Third, my lab has grown very quickly, so I am not looking for single term (e.g., summer) researchers. Please understand that I get many requests to join my lab for a single term (especially summer), and I may not respond to all of them. If you are looking to join my lab on a long-term basis, feel free to contact me.


If you understand the above and still want to contact me, great! I want to know you and what interests you about my work. Please email me with your name, academic status/year, and something you found interesting about one of my papers.
