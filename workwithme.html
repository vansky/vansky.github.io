I am currently looking for motivated undergraduate and graduate students with whom to conduct interesting research. However, I get a lot of mail, so please read this before contacting me. First, I cannot directly intervene on your behalf in acceptance to Cornell. Just follow the normal application process. Second, I do not currently have funding for student researchers, so working with me would strictly be a way of gaining research experience while working on fun topics. If you understand the above and still want to contact me, great! I want to know you and what interests you about my work. Please email me with your name, academic status/year, and something you found interesting about one of my papers.
