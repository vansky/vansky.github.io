I am an assistant professor of [linguistics](https://linguistics.cornell.edu/) at [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu/). I am very interested in the incremental representations that humans use to process language, and in differences between how language is used and how it is processed. To explore these topics, I study the relationships between computational language models and psycholinguistic data (e.g., reading times) and I study neural network representations of language to understand what aspects of language can be learned from language statistics directly without having experiences in the real world (i.e. through ungrounded learning).

Outside of work, I enjoy travel, dinner parties, and gardening.

I manage the [Computational Psycholinguistics Discussions research group](/cpsyd.html) (C.Psyd).

### Recent News

Sept 18: 2 papers accepted at CoNLL.

Aug 27: Submitted a paper showing that garden path effects cannot be predicted solely by surprisal. Feedback appreciated! [Single-stage prediction models do not explain the magnitude of syntactic disambiguation difficulty](https://psyarxiv.com/sgbqy/)

May 13: Gave an invited talk to CPL Lab at MIT: [Language is not Language Processing](/assets/pdf/vanschijndel-2020-invited_mit-slides.pdf)

April 30: Forrest Davis' [paper](/assets/pdf/davis_vanschijndel-2020-cogsci.pdf) was accepted to CogSci! Explores the ability to learn situation knowledge and discourse representations from plain text.

April 4: Forrest Davis' [paper](/assets/pdf/davis_vanschijndel-2020-acl.pdf) was accepted to ACL! Explores aspects of language comprehension that cannot be learned by current language models.

March 19: Forrest Davis' [CUNY presentation](https://osf.io/thj6c/) went well. Explores the ability to learn situation knowledge and discourse representations from plain text.

December 13: Our [Neuropsychologia paper](https://doi.org/10.1101/717512) was finally accepted. Shows that linguistic prediction (lexical and syntactic) happens entirely in language-specific brain regions, rather than being driven by domain-general prediction mechanisms.
