I am a computational linguist currently working as
a postdoctoral fellow at [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/)
in the [Department of Cognitive Science](http://cogsci.jhu.edu/). I work with [Tal Linzen](http://tallinzen.net/) probing the extent to which neural networks can learn human-like linguistic representations.

My work mainly focuses on incremental models of language processing and often involves testing the predictions of computational models against human behavioral and neural responses (e.g., reading times, M/EEG, etc). I am especially interested in the influence of uncertainty on language processing.

Outside of work, I enjoy travel, dinner parties, and gardening.
